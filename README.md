I created this web template for my personal site (check it out at anthony.blog.br). Now, I’ve made it public for anyone who wants a simple website with an automatic HTML generator. Before you start using it, you need to modify both the HTML and Python files. In the HTML file, personalize your site information, such as the name, favicon, and links. In the Python file, specify the path to your site’s folder, where the posts will be stored.
